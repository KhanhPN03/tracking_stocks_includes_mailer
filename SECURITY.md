# 🔒 Security Guidelines

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICES

### 🚫 NEVER COMMIT THESE FILES:
- `.env` files (already in .gitignore)
- Any file containing real passwords, API keys, or secrets
- Database dumps with real user data
- SSL certificates or private keys

### 🔐 Environment Variables Security

#### Production Secrets:
- Use strong, randomly generated JWT secrets (minimum 64 characters)
- Use unique database passwords
- Enable 2FA on all service accounts
- Rotate API keys regularly

#### Example secure secret generation:
```bash
# Generate secure JWT secret
openssl rand -hex 64

# Generate secure password
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 📧 Email Configuration:
- Use Gmail App Passwords, not your real password
- Enable 2-Factor Authentication on Gmail
- Use a dedicated email for the application

### 🛡️ Database Security:
- Never use default passwords (root/password)
- Use environment variables for all credentials
- Enable authentication in production
- Use SSL/TLS connections in production

### 🔑 API Keys:
- Get your own API keys from:
  - Alpha Vantage: https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key
  - News API: https://newsapi.org/
- Never share API keys publicly
- Use different keys for development and production

### 🚀 Deployment Security:
- Set NODE_ENV=production
- Use HTTPS in production
- Enable CORS properly
- Set secure JWT expiration times
- Use rate limiting
- Enable security headers (helmet.js already configured)

### 📋 Security Checklist Before Deployment:
- [ ] All .env files are in .gitignore
- [ ] No hardcoded passwords or API keys in code
- [ ] Strong JWT secrets generated
- [ ] Database credentials secured
- [ ] CORS configured for production domain
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates configured

### 🐛 Reporting Security Issues:
If you find a security vulnerability, please email: security@yourapp.com
Do not create public issues for security vulnerabilities.

### 🔄 Regular Security Maintenance:
- Update dependencies monthly
- Rotate JWT secrets quarterly
- Review access logs monthly
- Update API keys as needed
- Monitor for security alerts

## 🛠️ Security Tools Included:
- Helmet.js for security headers
- Rate limiting with express-rate-limit
- Input validation with Joi
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token authentication
- CORS protection
- Environment variable validation
